# Hybrid AI Copilot (RAG + Web Search)

A full-stack conversational AI application that combines local document retrieval (RAG) with live internet search capabilities. Built with Python, Flask, LangChain, and open-source Hugging Face models.

🚀 **Live Demo:** [Run on Google Colab]((https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1djAR3LXsJNKP_JNw2_Fppae3Nh3SP4y4#scrollTo=JmjYBql2TJX0))

## ✨ Features

* **Three AI Modes:**
  * **Offline RAG:** Answers questions based purely on the documents you upload.
  * **Internet Search Only:** Bypasses local data to fetch live answers from the web.
  * **Hybrid Mode:** Searches your local knowledge base first, and falls back to the internet if it doesn't know the answer.
* **Local Vector Database:** Uses ChromaDB to securely store and search your uploaded documents completely offline.
* **Multi-Format Support:** Upload and chat with `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, and image files (`.png`, `.jpg`).
* **Open-Source LLMs:** Powered by TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat and sentence-transformers for completely free, local text generation and embeddings.
